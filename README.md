<p><b>Welcome to Circuit Pro</b> <i>the Mac-native PCB design tool.</i></p>
<p>Built from the ground up for macOS, Electron delivers a seamless, intuitive circuit design experience — with schematic and layout editor, component builder and native performance. Beautiful, powerful, and made for hardware designers who think different.</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Electron is in early development. Many features are still in progress — but your feedback can help shape what comes next. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/x33025/Electron/issues) and let us know what you’d like to see.

## Motivation

<p>There are very few PCB design tools on the market—and even fewer available for Apple platforms. <i>This sparked an idea</i>: what if there were a PCB EDA tool designed specifically for macOS?</p>

<p>One built with style, ease of use, and intuitive workflows at its core? These are the principles that <strong>Electron</strong> is built on. Our goal is to make PCB design not only accessible to everyone, but also a delightfully seamless experience on the Mac.</p>
